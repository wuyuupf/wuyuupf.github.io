I am a Research Scientist at Meta. My research interests span machine learning, reinforcement learning, and optimization. In particular, I focus on:

- **Reinforcement Learning Theory**: Developing theoretical foundations for reinforcement learning algorithms, especially in the context of offline RL and actor-critic methods
- **Machine Learning**: Working on problems at the intersection of optimization and learning theory
- **Applications**: Applying theoretical insights to practical problems in real-world systems

Before joining Meta, I completed my Ph.D. at Northwestern University.
